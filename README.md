# infinite-scroll-vs-reddit
Technical test for TransPerfect junior Frontend position.

To run this application on your computer you must download the zip file of the full project and open it with your usual code editor, I use VSCode, or open a Terminal to initialize the react-app.

To do so with npm write `$ npm install` to install the required dependencies, and then use the `$ npm start` command to run it on your localhost.

As framework I used ReactJS, and the infinite scroll part is made with an `intersectionObserver` and `useEffect`.

Everything is made with just:

- ReactJS
- CSS
